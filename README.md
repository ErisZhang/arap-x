# As Rigid as Possible - INF555

Three.js based 3d mesh deformation sandbox. This project was developed for the *INF555 - Digital Representations and Analysis of Shapes* course at Ecole Polytechnique. 

Demo available at: https://arap-x.herokuapp.com/

## How build/run locally
To easily build and run the sandbox locally just run the following commands in the root:

```
$ docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```

The generated docker image is heroku ready!
